Commotion Linux - Python Implementation
=======================================

This is an initial implementation of core Commotion functionality in the form of a python module, commotionc, and related scripts.  None of the code in this bundle is intended to be called directly, but rather serves as a backend for commotion-mesh-applet and nm-applet-olsrd.  Future versions of this code will allow for full command-line control of the Commotion software stack via one unified binary.
