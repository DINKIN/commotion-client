#TODO
#    def write_wpasupplicant_config(self, profile):
#    def check_chipset

#    def startCommotion
#    def stopCommotion
#    Wrappers for standard connect and fallback, and disconnection routine (which should not be in nm-dispatcher, after all)
#    Can be the basis of any easy-to-use command line engine
#    Couch all subprocess commands in the sort of structure shown for startOlsrd, to allow for proper output
#    Decompose fallback routine itself, such that it doesn't even need to be installed by default?
#    Allow specification/choice of interface, in cases where there is more than one option
#    Add logic to intelligently chose the best of multiple interfaces, fall back to other if that doesn't work
#    Replace ifconfig call with ip call?
#    See if wpa_cli and wpa_gui can be made to work with version 2.0
#    Port applet display logic to fallback routine
#    Add DNS acquisition logic
#    Add Dependencies: iw, vi, pkill, gksu
#    Check and refine generate_ip, selectInterface, and GTK profile editor  
#    Thread driver checks through both submodules: force the applet to use the best option, and tell nm-dispatcher to give up if it's using a bad interface (can you get it to switch, perhaps?!?
#    Replace subprocess calls with os.lchmod, os.kill
#    NO RELATIVE PATHS IN SUBPROCESS CALLS
#    Should name of profile displayed by mesh applet be name of the file, or name of the SSID specified in the file?  
#    Replace all gksu calls with gksudo
#    Refine ip generation logic, such that you'll never end up with a .0
#    Refine wpa_supplicant version check for debian; add to nm-dispatcher-olsrd
#    Add driver check override to nm-dispatcher-olsrd

"Done"

#    Restructure files so that everything is inside of "commotion" directories (in etc, pyshared, share, etc.)
#    Makes sure that all file writes are unbuffered (buffer=0 paramater)
#    Add autogeneration routine for .wpasupplicant files, or at least a check
#    Finish replacing all static mentions of '/etc/nm... with a variable
#    Add rfkill block wifi /unblock wifi to all routines
#    GTK profile editor?
#    IBSS_RSN check, via iw list
#    Driver check
#    Change install of pyjavaproperties to be done through pipy repo, post install hook
#    Add full up/down logic to fallback script, such that it can be called by the mesh applet's disconnect function, and not result in the generation of multiple password prompts
#    Make inactive menu items grey, not invisible
#    Remove/overhaul debug log call
#    Get mesh status buttons to appear conditionally
