#    def write_wpasupplicant_config(self, profile):
#    def check_chipset

#    def startCommotion
#    def stopCommotion
#    Wrappers for standard connect and fallback, and disconnection routine (which should not be in nm-dispatcher, after all)
#    Can be the basis of any easy-to-use command line engine
#    Couch all subprocess commands in the sort of structure shown for startOlsrd, to allow for proper output
#    Remove pyjavaproperties
#    Add full up/down logic to fallback script, such that it can be called by the mesh applet's disconnect function, and not result in the generation of multiple password prompts
#    Decompose fallback routine itself, such that it doesn't even need to be installed by default?
#    Driver check
#    Allow specification/choice of interface, in cases where there is more than one option
#    Replace ifconfig call with ip call?
#    See if wpa_cli and wpa_gui can be made to work with version 2.0
#    Port applet display logic to fallback routine
#    Add DNS acquisition logic

"Done"

#    Restructure files so that everything is inside of "commotion" directories (in etc, pyshared, share, etc.)
#    Makes sure that all file writes are unbuffered (buffer=0 paramater)
#    Add autogeneration routine for .wpasupplicant files, or at least a check
#    Finish replacing all static mentions of '/etc/nm... with a variable
